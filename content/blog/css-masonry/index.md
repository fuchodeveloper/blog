### What is CSS Masonry?

CSS Masonry refers to a way of dynamically laying out items on a web page based on the available space, with the goal of creating a visually appealing or staggered brick-like appearance. You might have seen this layout on popular websites such as Pinterest, Unsplash, Pexels and on BeyoncÃ©'s website <a href="https://iam.beyonce.com" target="_blank">iam.beyonce.com â†—ï¸Ž</a>.

Okay??? What's so special about the layout you ask. Well, traditionally achieving this layout has required using JavaScript libraries such as `Masonry.js` or hacky CSS solutions. With the CSS Grid Layout Module Level 3 now including masonry, we can achieve the desired result natively. As at the time of writing, there is still limited support for masonry in the popular browsers, you can check <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=masonry" target="_blank">caniuse.com â†—ï¸Ž</a> to learn more as the adoption rate increases.

### How to Implement CSS Masonry

Below is a screenshot of the page we'll be implement using purely CSS, with some JavaScript to add border colors instead of writing multiple classes for each divðŸ˜….

#### Staggered CSS Masonry Grid:

The CSS Masonry layout is achieved using the grid display property combined with the masonry keyword. Here is the full code without any external library:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Pure CSS Masonry Layout</title>
    <style>
      .masonry {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
        grid-template-rows: masonry;
        gap: 16px;
      }

      .masonry-item {
        background-color: #f4f4f4;
        padding: 16px;
        font-size: 1rem;
        border-radius: 8px;
        border: 4px solid;
      }
    </style>
    <script defer>
      // JavaScript to add border colors instead of creating 10 different classes
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        const colors = [
          "#a2d2ff",
          "#cdb4db",
          "#b9fbc0",
          "#f4a261",
          "#f4c7ab",
          "#fcbf49",
          "#00a8cc",
          "#9d8189",
          "#b0b0b0",
          "#ff6b6b",
        ]
        const gridItems = document.querySelectorAll(".masonry-item")

        gridItems.forEach(
          (item, index) => (item.style.borderColor = colors[index])
        )
      })
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="masonry">
      <div class="masonry-item one">

        cant pay you i need this to work in internet explorer!. Jazz it up a
        little. It needs to be the same, but totally different just do what you
        think. I trust you, yet make it pop, for can you pimp this powerpoint,

        theme i was going for, yet can you make the logo bigger yes bigger
        bigger still the logo is too big, and i was wondering if my cat could be
        placed over the logo in the flyer make the font bigger we don't need a

        9. what is lorem ipsum? why is the text in spanish?.
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### How does it work:

- `grid-template-columns`: Defines flexible columns, ensuring responsiveness with `auto-fill` and `minmax`.

- `grid-template-rows: masonry;`: Enables masonry behavior for rows. Items stack naturally in available space.

### Current limitations

Native CSS Masonry support is currently available on Firefox Nightly edition and Safari/Safari Technology Preview. 

`Note: you need to enable the feature flag in Safari using the following steps:`> Safari Settings â†’ Feature Flags â†’ CSS Masonry Layout.

### Takeaway

CSS Masonry native support in CSS is a powerful gamechanger which enables creating dynamic and beautiful layouts with minimal support, and the sweetest part is, you can reduce dependencies on external JavaScript libraries and simplify your codebase to make maintenance and further development more fun. A win-win for both Product Design and Development teamsðŸŽ‰.
